# Introduction to the Semantic (Web) Technologies

## Berners-Lee

> The **Semantic Web** is a 'web of data' that facilitates machines to understand the semantics, or meaning, of information on the WWW.



## Problem with WWW: **HUMANS ONLY!**

-> Can we make the data on the Web explicit and machine readable?

> LINKED DATA



## Linked Data basic principles

1. Use URIs
2. Use Http URIs
3. Provide useful information about what a name identifies when it's looked up, using open standards such as RDF, SPARQL, etc.
4. Refer to other things using their HTTP URI-based names



## Data Integration
**Data Set**

**Merge in an abstract data model**

**Add more information**

Problem is that the machine doesn't know ```a:author == a:auteur```

**Extending merged data**

**What did we do?**

1. We combined different datasets that
   - are somewhere on the Web
   - are of different formats
   - have different names for relations
2. We could combine the data because some URIs were identical
3. We could add some simple extra info

**As a result, new relations could be found and retrieved**



## Ontology

### Ontology in Philosophy

In Philosophy,

> Ontology is the study of being or existence.
>
> It aims to find out what entities and types of entities exist.

### Ontology in Computer Science

> An explicit specification of a conceptualisation
>
> 개념화의 명시적인 사양..?

## For example

- Schema.org
- Google's Knowledge Graph
- Wikidata
- Ontologies in sciences
- Semantic Technologies at the BBC

## Ontology-based data access (OBDA)

Ontology

- gives a high-level conceptual view of the data
- provides a convenient & natural vocabulary for user queries
- enriches incomplete data with background knowledge
